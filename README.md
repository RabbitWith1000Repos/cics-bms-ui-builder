# CICS BMS UI builder

A version of this script reduced the amount of work I had to do in one of my
COBOL classes so much I could spend the rest of my time in that class
~grabbing MP3s using Napster~ ~practicing rocket jumping in Quake~
studying for my British Literature class.

[Read the comic](https://rabbitwith1000repos.com/comics/009-language-learning/)
that inspired this project!

## Setup

* Install [Perlito 5](https://github.com/fglock/Perlito)
  in an adjacent directory and
  [build the Perl 5 Node compiler](https://github.com/fglock/Perlito/blob/master/README-perlito5.md).
  * [Perlbrew](https://perlbrew.pl/) makes that a lot easier.
* Install Node 14 (I suggest [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm)) and
  `npm install`.
* Run `npm run dev`.
* Open [http://localhost:8080](https://localhost:8080) and
  type in your advanced terminal UI.

## Why?!?

Because who doesn't want to use Node to compile Perl for use
in the browser to build UIs for an [ancient mainframe technology?](http://www.mftutor.com/cics/bms/bms-macro/dfhmdf/)!?
